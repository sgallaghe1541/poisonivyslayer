AUTHOR'S FOREWORD

I should start by admitting something you've probably already figured out: Bland
Pseudonym is not my actual legal name. Really. Not that I've anything against my name, but
when dealing with a topic as dangerous as poison ivy I would prefer to maintain a low profile.
If you are wondering why, I invite you to reflect for a moment on the fact that my parents did not
name me "Sue Me". I never once considered having the words "Sue Me" tattooed on my
forehead. Poison ivy slaying involves risks; I willingly accept the risks associated with my
activities, but those risks pale in comparison to the risks of lawsuits. Funny thing about lawsuits
and nuclear war: even if you win, you lose. No thank you. I'd rather remain anonymous.
There's always a danger when writing about doing something dangerous: not everyone is
a critical thinker while they're reading. Consider a hypothetical example: suppose you stumbled
upon a document titled How to Jump out of an Airplane Without a Parachute and Survive. The
author then tells stories about how he has jumped out of a variety of different airplanes
repeatedly and never once had to use a parachute. He tells the stories in enough detail that you
are convinced he is speaking from personal experience. He then goes on to teach you standard
paratrooper training points about how to perform a "Parachute Landing Fall". When properly
done, this 5 point technique will dissipate the impact of the fall and allow you to survive a major
fall uninjured. Suppose you then search Google and get verification that this is a legitimate
technique. So you're convinced. Suppose you decide this is something worth trying. Which is
a real shame, because there's something that the author failed to mention: All those times he
jumped out of an airplane without a parachute, the plane was on the ground and stationary. The
author didn't include that detail because he considered it so blindingly obvious that he wouldn't
have to. But suppose for you, he did have to. And so suppose splat. Okay, you can stop
supposing now.
All of which is to say that I urge you to think critically about what you are reading.
Don't just do something as risky as poison ivy slaying just because you read one document.
Consult other sources, get the best advice you can, and proceed cautiously. I'm giving you
honest information from personal experience here, and I'm doing my best to not leave anything
out; still, I'm only human and I don't know what my blind spots are. I've got a family to feed,
and I'd prefer not to paint a target on my back. (Some people reading this may know who I am,
but please don't spread it around. I don't need that kind of fame.)
Despite my desire for anonymity, a bit of personal background is in order here: Assisting
with poison ivy eradication was my first job; I started when I was three year's old. My parents
wanted to move to a town that had a better school district than the one they were living in, but
they were not finding anything they could afford. Eventually, though, they found a rental
property that was just about perfect for them. It had one major problem: it was covered in
poison ivy. As Dad described it, "If it was green, it was poison ivy." And so he started
working at removing it. He had me accompany him and he gave me a responsibility: I was his
poison ivy spotter. He taught me to recognize poison ivy (a good idea for any kid, but
especially one living where we did). He then asked me to point out any poison ivy he missed.
I'm sure he just wanted to spend time with me and to give Mom a break, but (according to him
later) I started getting good at it. I was genuinely spotting some very small and hard to spot
seedlings. For my part, I considered it a fun game. My dad's encouragement and gratitude was
a big help too. Mainly, though, I had a sense that I was accomplishing something worthwhile.
I was hooked.

My dad succeeded in keeping poison ivy under control at our house for decades. The
first few years were hard and time consuming. Soon, though, it became a minor chore. He
eventually helped out taming poison ivy in the surrounding area as well. I knew firsthand that
what he was doing was actually effective.
Years later, after I had a family of my own, I moved to a house at an ideal location with a
big poison ivy problem; now it's my turn. My dad reviewed the process with me, and I got to
work. After the first year, I had made visible progress but I still had big problem. After the
second year it was obvious I had it on the run. A few years later, and I was able to consider it
under control. Decades later, I find that I can just go over the property about once a year and
get rid of any fresh seedling. It's not extinct, but it's not a problem.
Like my dad, I found opportunities to help others by assisting them in taming their own
poison ivy problems. There are a couple of Christian camps locally that I have also been able to
help out. I don't do it for profit, but I am pleased to be able to accomplish something
worthwhile. I'm still hooked.
At some point it occurred to me that it might be nice to set down on paper (or on .pdf) my
instructions and advice on the subject of poison ivy eradication. I'm not an obvious person to do
so; I'm neither a botanist nor an environmentalist. Neither was my Dad. I've had no formal
training on the subject, and I've never really done any serious academic research on it. I've
never made any money off poison ivy removal. My sole credential as a poison ivy slayer is
experience. I've gotten some impressive results (if I do say so myself), just like my father
before me. If I can pass on some experience that might help others get similarly impressive
results, wonderful.
This is intended to be a personal reflection. As you may have noticed, this document is
sort of turning into my memoir. I get too few opportunities to ramble, so I'm taking advantage
of this one. You can listen in or tune me out, your choice.

THE BASICS

Poison ivy is a plant found throughout the eastern United States and Canada. It is (I'm
told) found elsewhere as well, but I don't go there so that's your problem not mine. This plant
produces an oily set of compounds known collectively as urushiol. The sap of this plant is
loaded with the stuff. If you touch the leaves of this plant and get this oily compound on your
skin, it is quickly absorbed and produces a painful itchy rash that lasts many days. You can also
get this compound on you if you break or cut the stem (technically the aerial root). It's even
worse if you ingest it or inhale the smoke from burning it.
Not everyone reacts to poison ivy. Some people will not react at all when exposed to
poison ivy. Most people do, and some react very badly. If you are one of the lucky few who
don't, it is best still to minimize your exposure. Poison ivy is a sensitizer, so you might develop
a reaction over time and over repeated exposures. I never got it until I was in my late twenties,
then I did. Nothing ever happens until it happens for the first time. Be warned.
Don't overreact to the first word in the name of this plant: poison ivy is not in the same
category as anthrax or botulism. Urushiol won't kill you; it will just suck all the joy out of your
life for a few days. (I am told there are very rare fatalities; please consult internet rumors and
the legal department for more details.)
Then again, don't underestimate the negative effects of poison ivy. Having a painful

rash affects your behavior and your attitude. You find poison ivy outside in the wild; there's a
big wide wonderful world outside that is just waiting to be enjoyed, and anything that interferes
with that enjoyment is a serious problem. You go out hiking (or even just playing in the
backyard), you run into poison ivy and get a rash, you decide it wasn't that much fun after all,
and you decide instead to go inside and play video games. Pretty soon everyone is inside
playing videogames, and what kind of a world would you get? Oh yeah, the world we have
right now. Now I enjoy a good video game every so often, but I know from personal experience
that getting out in nature regularly is good for my own mental health. So poison ivy acts as a
nudge in the wrong direction; consider what would happen if that direction was reversed. I
mean, just imagine what would happen if videogame controllers were altered to be able to give
you a skin rash that sucked all the joy out of life for a few days.
Okay, I just imagined it. Oh man. If I were a mad scientist I would totally invent that
and make it clear to everyone that I had it and was prepared to use it. Talk about power. The
nations of the world would tremble at the very thought of the horrors I could unleash upon
humanity. They would fall all over themselves in a mad rush to obey my merest whim, lest I
carry through with my implied threat. And if I did have to drop the bomb, what then? People
would decide that first person shooter games were really not worth it, so instead they would find
a creek somewhere and catch salamanders and crawdads, and the world would be a better place
as a result. So: global domination, with a side of altruism; what's not to love?
... Okay, deep breath. I'm back. Don't mind me; I just get that way sometimes. It's a
good thing I'm not a mad scientist. Yet.
For the record: I don't hate poison ivy. The poison ivy plant is a native species in this
area, so it has every right to be a part of this environment (unlike some other ivy plants I could
name, and yes, I'm looking at you kudzu.) When I go to a national park, I will sometimes spot
poison ivy vines that I'm pretty sure are older than I am; but since it is not bothering anyone
there, I smile and walk on. I also smile when I see poison ivy grow where nothing else would
be able to (on sand dunes at a beach, for example.) The biosphere would be a poorer place
indeed if this plant went extinct.
Even urushiol has an upside. I am told that the Japanese use the urushiol from a related
plant to produce a particularly strong and beautiful lacquer. (So wait a minute. Somebody
talks the toxin from poison ivy, coats it on pots etc. and puts it in people's houses, and persuade
everyone that this is a good thing? Wow, I thought I was a mad scientist wannabe, but even I
never dreamed up a scheme like that. Bravo.)
Therefore, my goal is to keep the poison ivy plant under control and away from where
people are likely to encounter it. I also want to be able to provide others with what they need to
help with this effort. This document is written to that end.

RECOGNISING POISON IVY

For starters, consider the old saying "Leaves of three, let it be." That's a good place to
start. Just take a look at this picture:

Note the three leaflets. Note the "T" shaped connection between them; it is short at the top but
long extending to the middle leaflet. Note also that the leaflets are all pointed at the end.
Beyond that, the appearance of a poison ivy leaf can vary considerably. Its edges may
be jagged or smooth. It may or may not have a shiny appearance. Its color and size may vary
considerably. There might be regional differences, but what I've noticed is that there can be
different appearances within the same region. So to find out the possible appearances in your
area, go out, find some poison ivy plants, and study their appearances.
So, okay, how do you spot a poison ivy plant if you can't rely on the appearance of the
leaves? It is actually easier to spot a mature poison ivy plant by looking at its stem (or, to be
technical, aerial roots). Look for a root growing on the side of a tree. It won't be wound
around the tree; it will grow more or less straight up. Note that the root will have a hairy
appearance. Here's a good example:

Again, the appearance can vary, but the appearance of the root is more constant than the
appearance of the leaves. Note that there are some other types of vines that also have similar
aerial roots. The Virginia creeper, for example, has hairy aerial roots (although the "hairs" are
generally thicker and longer). So look for the combination of leaves of three coming off a hairy
aerial root. That combination pretty much guarantees that it is poison ivy. If you want further
confirmation, look for round white or green berries at the end of the branches:

Depending on the season or the age of the plant, you might not see them; if you do, though, then
it is confirmed to be definitely poison ivy. Once you spot one, look around you; you will
probably spot very similar ones in the surrounding area with very similar leaves. No
coincidence, that; those are its progeny. Keep track of their appearance; you will be seeing
more of them all over the place in your region.

By the way, I have my own version of that old saying: "Leaves of three, let them be.
Unless you're me, if so - yippee!".
Once you get used to spotting actual poison ivy in your area, it is a good idea to start
familiarizing yourself with the local poison ivy mimics. Not everything with leaves of three is
toxic. The obvious example: "Leaves of three, straw-bear-ree". (Not a common saying, but
perhaps it should be.) The strawberry plant has leaves with three leaflets on them, although the
leaflets are not pointed. There are varieties of other plants in my area that have leaves of three;
most are either herbaceous or otherwise identifiable as not poison ivy. I've found it useful to
identify common mimics at a glance; it helps cut down on the plant equivalent of a wild goose
chase.

Here’s a quick example of a mimic:

I did a Google search on this picture, and Google said it was likely poison ivy. Shortly after I
took this picture, I picked these leaves and rubbed them vigorously on my upper arm. I never
got any rash, so I can be confident a week later that it was not poison ivy. (I point and laugh at
Google here.) I also noted that the leaf arrangement was opposite, not alternate (like poison
ivy). The plant was also shrubby, not viney. I was quite certain it was not poison ivy before I
tested it on myself. I would not recommend self-testing; still, it is a great way of convincing
others that you are confident you know what you’re doing. Be warned: mistakes of this nature
can be rather embarrassing (and worse!)
I try to avoid killing mimics. Sometimes I do anyway when I'm not absolutely sure it’s a
mimic. Sometimes I do when I'm trying to impress the people I'm doing it for and I don't want
them to think I missed one. And sometimes I do when I'm just in a bad mood. There's a
cautionary tale there somewhere. Don't pretend to be something that people want to kill,
because sometimes people are in a bad mood.

Just to give you practice at spotting poison ivy, here are a few pictures that have poison
ivy plants in them. How long does it take to spot you to spot them? (Answer key at the back of
this document):

HOW POISON IVY SPREADS AND TAKES OVER

Once you've learned to spot poison ivy, you need to learn to think like a poison ivy plant.
Consider how it goes about its plan for world conquest.

Here's where it all begins: the seedling. It can show up anywhere, but seems to grow
best around the edge of a forest in a spot with plenty of sunshine near trees that are waiting to be
taken advantage of. It will grow throughout the summer, lose its leaves in the fall, and then go
dormant in the winter. It will be ready to return in the spring.

Early in the spring, you will notice some shoots that start to develop the familiar leaves of
three pattern. It is in a good position to catch the sunlight and shade the surrounding plants. As
it grows, it either will develop into a small shrub (particularly if it had good sunlight) or will just
form a patch of little stems. I've seen both. It's growing, but the most important growth is
happening underground. It's sending out runners; the root will grow out until it sends out some
new shoots about 1-2 feet away.

At first glance, this might appear to be a picture of isolated seedlings. Note, though, the even
spacing between the plants. If you were to pull up one of the, you would find that they are all
connected. These runners will keep spreading until you get a thick patch of poison ivy. Given
time, it will eventually shade out the other plants in the area and become the dominant life form.
Nasty, but that's not its real goal.

Aha, jackpot! The root has eventually found what it is really looking for - a tree to grow
up on. Note that it isn't really hurting the tree (uncharacteristically benevolent for such a nasty
plant); it is just using the tree trunk as a support in its effort to overshade and conquer the world.
Seizing the high ground is a strategy as old as war itself. The vine will grow up quite high in
the tree. Over time, the aerial root will grow quite thick and the branches extending out from it
will grow quite large. It will resemble a tree on a tree.

Eventually, you will start getting berries. The poison ivy plant is now a reproducing vine.
When those green berries turn white, they are ripe. Many will just drop off, scattering seeds in
the surrounding area to further saturate it with new plants to eliminate the competition. Some of
the berries are eaten by birds; the seed passes through the bird’s digestive tract and then is
planted splat along with fertilizer at a place quite far from the original plant. New worlds, just
waiting to be conquered. And so the pattern begins again. And again and again.
Just when all hope seems lost and the world looks doomed, a hero shows up. You.
Cure the theme music. It's time to get to work.

WHAT A WELL-DRESSED HERO WEARS

Obviously, you won't be dressed just like someone else going out in the woods. You're
dressed to kill. Literally, in this case. You are going to be depending on your clothing as the
last line of defense against urushiol. How you dress is up to you; you want to be comfortable
with your choice, though. I have nothing against the disposable Tyvek chemical workers
garments per se; I just consider them hot and impractical. Then again, dressing up in one of
those is a great way of being inconspicuous and blending in.
Me? I generally wear good denim pants with reasonably thick socks. I used to wear old
sneakers that I set aside specifically for poison ivy; recently, though, I've been forgetting to

switch from my ordinary sneakers and so far, they haven't contaminated me. I wear a long-
sleeved baseball shirt with a flannel overshirt if the weather is at all cold. I wear leather work

gloves when I need to, but generally keep them in my back pocket. Most of the time when I've
gotten a poison ivy rash it has been on my wrists, so I've taken to cutting the end off an old sock
and wearing the sock over my wrists.
A word about clothing: if you are going to do your job effectively, you will eventually
need to walk through a patch of poison ivy plants. Try to avoid contact, but don't obsess; you
eventually need to decide to just plow through it. As far as I can tell, I've never gotten poison

ivy through blue jeans.
Don't forget to accessorize. I wear a washable hat to protect from sunlight, rain, and
ticks. Sunscreen and bug spray are both in order. I generally wear a lightweight backpack with

a pocket to keep a disposable water bottle in. (As you will recall, you will be wearing long-
sleeves and long pants today; you will get hot, so remember to stay hydrated.) The backpack is

also a good place to keep an umbrella (to ensure that it won't rain), a camera (we'll talk about that
one later), and possibly lunch (yum). The straps of the backpack are also a convenient place to
hold your lopping shears as long as you can manage not to stab yourself in the armpit with it.
One last thing and this is important: put an unsharpened pencil in your back pocket,
eraser side down. Murphy's Law says that right when you are in the middle of a major
operation, your forehead will itch furiously. You will be tempted unthinkingly to scratch your
forehead with your gloves. That's kind of an embarrassing place to get a poison ivy rash.
Instead, grab the pencil with your gloved hand, scratch your forehead with the eraser, and put it
back in your pocket.
Be sure there is an empty washing machine available when you are done. As soon as
you are through for the day, wash your clothes and take a shower. The shower isn't really to
deal with contact with poison ivy plants (that ship has already sailed) but rather to deal with your
probably inevitable contact with contaminated clothing as you take it off. Besides, getting a
shower is seldom a bad idea. Just remember: cleanliness is next to Godliness, but don't bother
me about it until I get number one down pat.

YOUR WEAPONS

When I go out killing poison ivy, I use three weapons: a good lopping shears, a bow saw
that is large enough to carry over my shoulder, and a sprayer of chemical herbicide.
Lopping shears have the advantage over handheld pruning shears in that your hands stay
further away from what you are cutting. You want bypass shears that are large enough to cut a
vine 1 inch in diameter. You want handles long enough to get good leverage but not so long
that they will be cumbersome to carry around in the woods. It helps if the handles are brightly
colored (I like yellow), because you will eventually need to set it down and you want to be able
to find it again quickly.
A bow saw is good for cutting anything larger than 1 inch or so. It does have the
disadvantage that it will generate urushiol-soaked sawdust (so be careful and upwind if possible
while you are using it). This disadvantage is easily counterbalanced by the emotional advantage
of the sheer joy of watching that plant ripped apart violently. (Okay, maybe that's just me.)
Your saw doesn't have to be as sturdy as a saw you would use to cut down a tree. After all, vine
wood is much weaker and softer than tree wood. (That one is even in the Bible; see Ezekiel 15.)
And then there's chemical herbicide. Yes, I use it on my own property. I always ask
before I use it for someone else. There are people who are opposed to the use of chemical
herbicides, and I will respect their wishes. Really, the saw and lopper are your primary
weapons; you can really get most poison ivy problems under control without a chemical
herbicide. For my part, I am not convinced that there is much risk of harm associated with
chemical herbicides when properly used with reasonable attention to safety. If you are
concerned, though, don't use them.
I know some people use agricultural strength vinegar mixed with salt and dish detergent.

(Be sure to use agricultural strength vinegar; regular vinegar is ineffective and apple cider
vinegar bestows immortality and that's the last thing you want a poison ivy plant to get.) Just
keep in mind that agricultural strength vinegar is actually quite a dangerous chemical, even
though it is considered non-toxic when diluted. Remember, water in sufficient quantities is
actually very dangerous; it's called drowning. I’m not posting a recipe here; you can ask your
rectangle of all knowledge and see what it says. I have had limited but definite success with a
recipe I got off the Internet. Whether or not it was more effective or safer than a commercial
herbicide I leave for others to answer, but I can resist commenting on it: Herbicides are designed
to block a particular enzyme that is only found in plants. Agricultural vinegar is used because it
kills everything it touches, with salt and detergent added to enhance its ability to achieve total
destruction. It’s kind of like having to shut down a computer; you can turn it off by pressing the
right switch, or you can take a sledgehammer to it and not worry particularly about aiming (and
accept that the table it is on will also be destroyed.) Both work, but I know which one I’d rather
clean up after.
One method I've seen advocated but I don't use: yanking the plant up by the roots. It
probably is quite effective against young plants, but I doubt it will be effective against an
established plant with lots of runners. I’ve never tried, and I’ve never found that I’ve needed to
try. My main objection to yanking is that it is intentionally contaminating your gloves.
Personal protection equipment should always be protection of last resort; a bulletproof vest does
not make you Superman. There’s a reason why rugby has far fewer injuries than football; I
suspect the reliance on protective equipment is somehow involved. If you choose to yank,
though, please be very careful (and find a different source of advice for doing it, since I don't
have experience here).
I'm sure there are other effective methods for killing poison ivy, but I've never had to
resort to them. I have at times been tempted to just cover up a patch of poison ivy with a large
cardboard box or a piece of plywood. I've also been tempted to have a goat eat the stuff.
(Goats are downright cute, so any excuse to get a goat has to be a good one.) There's a
drawback to any method that is not specifically targeting poison ivy, which I will discuss later.
Note also that I would strongly caution against the use of power saws, drills, line trimmers, or
lawn mowers; these have the effect of spreading urushiol over a wide area (not a good idea).
One last thing to remember: fire and poison ivy don't mix. You don't want to vaporize
urushiol. Or if you want to, you shouldn't. That's just nasty.

FIRST OBJECTIVE: REPRODUCING VINES

You need to be ready to play a long game. This is not going to be a quick fix. You
might not see much in the way of results the first year, but don't give up. Getting rid of all of
the established plants can take a couple years. After that, all that is necessary is to go over the
property once a year and get rid of any new seedlings. Think of it as mowing the grass, only
you only have to do it once a year. That's the goal. Ready to start heading there? Good.
I'm going to presume at this point that you know basic woodsmanship. There are other
dangers in the woods besides poison ivy. Can you spot a hornet's nest? How about a yellow
jacket's nest? Do you know what the poisonous snakes in your area look like? Do you know
how not to look like a deer during deer hunting season? Can you be careful not to step into an
old woodchuck hole that has gotten covered with leaves? (Why did I bring that one up? Don't

ask.) If you think you need help, consider going with someone who knows their way in the
woods better than you do. Even if you don't think you need help, consider going with someone
who knows their way in the woods better than you do. They're usually fun people to be around
anyway. The alternative is to watch _Ernest Goes to Camp_ and remember never to do this to a
family of badgers.
Now that you're out in the woods, the first step is to confirm the presence of poison ivy.
If you don't see any seedlings, congratulations (but be sure to check again next year.) If you do
see seedlings, start looking for established plants. Then start looking for strongholds (areas
where poison ivy is the dominant if not the only plant.) Once you've found a stronghold, look
up. Chances are you will see a reproducing vine on a tree. Occasionally you will find shrubs
with berries, but that's rarer. In any case, if you eliminate the source of new seedlings, your
major problem will be solved.
(Quick aside: _The Lord of the Rings_ is a 1200-page story about a ring getting dropped
in a volcano. The actual ring drop is described in a few lines. This handbook is not _The Lord
of the Rings_ but the whole point is killing the reproducing vine. The rest is just clean-up.
With that having been said, let's drop that ring....)

Here is a reproducing vine on a tree that is about to be cut. There are no branches in the way
here, but if there were, I would carefully remove them with lopping shears. I find a spot that
stands out well from the tree at approximately chest height.

I will then use my bow saw to cut most of the way through the vine. I will then make another
cut about 1-2 inches up (or down) from my first cut. I will then cut all the way through but I
will be very careful not to cut into the tree bark. I will then finish that first cut. Using the end
of the saw, I will then push out a small section of this vine. If it doesn't come out neatly, I can
usually pry it out with the open blade of my lopping shears. If absolutely necessary, I can
usually slip my bow saw blade between the section and the tree trunk (And that's it. The ring is down. Your real problem is now gone. Everything after this is just
scouring the Shire.)
Why remove the whole section instead of just relying on a single cut? Two reasons: 1)
There is great practical value in having a gap in the vine that is visible from far away. You are
likely to be walking through this area again next year, and it is helpful to be able to tell at a
glance that this is a vine that you have already dealt with. Anyone else will also be able to tell

at a glance that this vine is no longer a problem. And 2) I'll get to in the next section.
Why chest high? In a word, convenience. You are going to be working hard today, and
you want your job to be as convenient as possible. Some might worry that the remaining vine
will lead to new growth, but I've never seen that happen. If you want to bend over and cut it
right at ground level, go right ahead. Just remember to also cut out a section chest high so you'll
actually notice it next time you look at this tree.
I usually let the section of vine that I just remove stay where it lands. It's covered in
urushiol, but so is the rest of the area you're standing in. If you are at all worried that somebody
will find that section and keep it, you could always bag it up and throw it in the trash somewhere.
Once I've cut a section out of that vine, I look the tree over for any additional vines. Any

other reproducing vines can be dispatched the same way with your bow saw. Smaller, non-
reproducing vines (that will very soon become reproducing vines) can be given similar treatment

with lopping shears. Just remember to cut a 1-2 inch section out if it so you will know at a
glance that it has been dealt with. Once you're done with this tree, on to the next. I've never
been to a property that had only one reproducing vine, so you've still got work to do.
And, yes, you are walking away from the tree at that point. If you see it the next day, the
leaves of the vine will look distinctly wilted. A few days later and the leaves will be dead and
dropping off. You might want to warn people not to play in the dead leaves, but other than that,
just let nature take its course. If there are any ripe berries on the vine, they will drop off into the
soil below. Bummer, but it isn't like there aren't literally hundreds of seeds in the soil already.
Just walk away, and leave the vine (and therefore the urushiol) undisturbed. The urushiol will
eventually break down, but it takes five years or so for that to happen. Until then, leaving it
where it is is probably the safest option.
Do walk past it later to notice the difference. Being able to see the results before and
after (such as in the picture below) can be very encouraging. Encouragement is important.

TROPHY HUNTING

Remember the camera? Remember the second reason for removing a section of the
vine? Now it is time to have some fun.
If you cut a section out of a particularly large or impressive vine, take a picture of it
before disposing of it. Try to take a close up of the cut surface of the section. Use a flash, and
try to be sure that it is not blurry.
Later, try to count the tree rings so you can count the rings. It may be difficult to resolve
all of them, but you should at least be able to get an approximate age of your vine.
Here's one of mine. I kill poison ivy regularly at a local Bible camp; I thought I had
killed all the reproducing vines on their property until I happened upon this beauty. I walked
past this vine at least a half-dozen times before noticing it. It had mostly detached from the tree
at the bottom, so it looked like an ordinary tree trunk. It wasn't until I looked up that I noticed
that it was a reproducing poison ivy vine. Once I made one cut, the vine detached so I couldn't
actually cut out a section; since the two ends no longer lined up, I figured I could tell at a glance
that it was cut anyway.

I took a picture of the underside of the cut. Here it is:

Note that I've edited the picture by drawing lines on the rings. Every fifth line I draw in purple.
My estimation is that this vine was 32 years old. So naturally, I told the people at camp, "I
killed a 32 year old...poison ivy vine.". It's fun to say, particularly if you can string out the
ellipsis long enough to get people worried. On a more serious note, there something very
appealing about killing an old poison ivy vine. So much of like involves doing tasks to solve
problems that will be back tomorrow or next week. Even monthly chores can become drudgery.
As such, there's a marvelous sense of accomplishment that comes from solving a problem that
has been growing for decades. Eventually, poison ivy slaying will become a once-a-year chore,
so it is important and encouraging to remember what happens if you neglect it for long enough.
Oh, and for what it's worth, here is my all-time record (so far):

I'm thinking I can count 35 rings on it. This section was particularly heart-shaped. I can think
of a number of awful pranks that I could pull by taking advantage of the heart-shaped nature of
the poison ivy vine section, but I'm not going to do it. Really.

SECOND OBJECTIVE: BREAKING UP STRONGHOLDS

I define a stronghold as an area that is largely if not exclusively populated with poison
ivy. This is usually right around a reproducing vine (that hopefully you have just found and
killed.) There are enough plants in this area that one will inevitably find a tree or other climbing

surface and generate another reproducing vine. You've got some time before this happens, so
don't worry about breaking up strongholds until you are reasonably sure that you have eliminated
all the reproducing vines.
Keep in mind the long game. You will not be able to eliminate a stronghold in one year,
since whatever damage you inflict this year will not prevent it from growing back next year.
Patience. You can't win instantly, but you can make substantial progress each year.
I use chemical herbicides here. Be sure to read carefully the manufacturer's directions
and follow them. Keep in mind, though: you're not going to be able to get them all. Focus on
trying to kill the largest plants. Obviously try to get as many as possible, but don't spread it too
thin. It would be better to kill some of the plants than just to annoy them all but not kill any of
them.
One thing though: aim properly and carefully. It is very important that you miss any
plants that are not poison ivy. You want any other plants in the area to thrive; these plants are
your allies, since they will be stealing sunlight and ground water from any poison ivy plants in
the area. Keep in mind that if you were to kill all the plants in that area then since poison ivy is
a fierce competitor it will tend to grow back quicker than anything else does. Say to yourself as
you are spraying, "The weed of my weed is my crop." (That a modified version of an old Arab
saying that goes, "The enemy of my enemy is my friend". My version definitely works here;
I’m not too sure of the old Arab saying. I have enemies, and they don't think too much of me.
Those enemies also have enemies, but they don't think too much of me either. In fact, even they
have enemies, and even they don't take too kindly to me. Okay, maybe there's a reason I'm in a
room by myself typing about making war on plants instead of being off at a party somewhere.)
It's worth noticing what the good competitors against poison ivy are in your area. In my
area, the best is usually the Virginia creeper. It looks a lot like poison ivy, but it has five leaves
instead of three. And no urushiol. It is an important enough competitor that it gets included in
one version of the old saying: "Leave of three, let them bee; leaves of five, let them thrive." In
any case, you need to be careful spraying around any Virginia creeper you see, even if it means
leaving some poison ivy unsprayed. If you can get the Virginia creeper to crowd out the poison
ivy, your job will be much easier.
(Oh, and remember what I said about not killing any plants other than poison ivy? I take
that back in the case of kudzu. Kudzu is just evil. It's kind of like the plant equivalent of the
Weeping Angels from Dr. Who. Kill it wherever you can anyway.)
Do what damage you can, then move on. Remember the location of this stronghold.
Next spring, try to catch it right when the first shoots start coming up. Spray those carefully,
then if possible come back and spray in a few weeks. Don't overspray, though; you want to be
careful to protect the other plants as much as possible.
During the entire first year, it may seem like an impossible task. Second year may still
seem daunting, but it at least seems possible. After the third year, the task becomes
manageable. You will still have some established plants and seedlings to deal with, but poison
ivy will now no longer be the dominant plant in that area. Congratulations, you've broken the
stronghold.

THIRD OBJECTIVE: CLEAN UP

If you've gotten rid of all the reproducing vines and strongholds, your poison ivy problem

is essentially reduced to maintenance - the equivalent of mowing your lawn, only with poison
ivy. You haven't completely solved your problem, since any established plants just tend to keep
coming back for several years before they eventually die. Even then, your problem remains,
since the soil around any reproducing vines will still have literally hundreds of seeds in them.
Beyond that, you still have a problem of birds bringing new seeds into your area. The price of
poison ivy free is eternal vigilance. Besides, it is a good excuse for a walk in the woods.

HOW TO HAVE A POISON IVY RASH

Despite your best efforts, sometimes you get a rash from poison ivy. Proper precaution
and experience will minimize the risk, but sometimes you get it nonetheless. I know. As I am
typing this sentence, my right arm is itching like the proverbial dickens. There's a generalized
itch, but there's only a few spots I can see. It might get worse tomorrow, but I'm pretty sure this
will be it.
(Yes, it was poison ivy. It lasted a few days, and then it got better. I've had it a lot
worse, but it is never fun when you get it.)
I note that there are many good medical websites out there describing poison ivy. They
even have pictures. So I will direct you to one of them for more reliable information than I can
provide you. Just avoid looking at the pictures; they'll give you the willies. When in doubt,
talk to your doctor.
My experience has been that I have with me at all times a bottle of calamine lotion (or the
equivalent) for one to three days after I've been out killing poison ivy. If I am actually going to
get it, I will catch myself absentmindedly scratching at an itchy spot. Once I catch myself doing
it, I immediately stop. (You don't want to scratch the itch; it will just make it worse.) I apply
some lotion on the spot; not that it is really going to help but it will feel good having something
to do instead of just itching. I note the spot and check it periodically. It might be nothing, but
if it turns into an irregular patch of redness, I start chiding myself for not being more careful. If
it starts to develop tiny blisters under the skin, I chide myself even worse. After that, I just try
to keep it from getting further irritated, I put some lotion on it when it really bothers me, and I
just wait for it to go away. You can't really "treat" a poison ivy rash - once the urushiol gets
absorbed onto your skin, you just have to put up with it until it runs its course (usually a week to
ten days). Scratching it won't spread the urushiol (I'm told), breaking the blisters won't spread
the urushiol, but allowing it to heal undisturbed should diminish both the intensity and the
duration of your suffering. Plus, you really don't want it to get infected.
Be sure to seek medical attention if you have a fever, shortness of breath, or any of the
other conditions that reliable medical advice websites list. Otherwise, you just have to put up
with it.
As you suffer, you might as well consider whether or not there is an upside to having a
poison ivy rash. I could consider the spiritual benefits of suffering, but I'm not really sure I'm
qualified to do that. My life had been amazingly free of suffering. I'll leave that to the
theologians and the pillar saints. I do have one interesting observation about what a poison ivy
rash is like....
When you have a poison ivy rash, your skin has a legitimate complaint against you. You
can say it was all for the greater good, but that's not going to help your skin. You can assign
blame, but again that won't help. Your skin will be loudly complaining that conditions are
unacceptable. You already know that, but it won't stop complaining. You try to do something

to show you care, and maybe that reduces the intensity of it but doesn't solve it. Your skin
wants you to scratch it, but you know that will not really help. Your skin won’t take no for an
answer, but you’re the one in charge. If you give in, it might feel better for a moment but it will
make your skin more miserable afterwards and perhaps do lasting damage. If you lose your
composure, it only makes things worse. The nagging continues every waking hour, and might
even invade your dreams. You just have to put up with that. You start desperately searching
for a way of fixing the situation, but the sad truth is there isn't one and you and your skin are just
going to have to accept that. And just when the situation seems beyond hope, things get better.
Healing starts on its own without any help from you. Eventually, the problem just goes away,
and both you and your skin will take it for granted (until the next time.)
Read that last paragraph again; what does it remind you of? To me, it reminds me of
parenthood. Not all of parenthood, certainly. But some situations and some seasons just seem
like that. So I consider having a poison ivy rash the to be good preparation and training for at
least certain aspects of parenthood. Maybe that's just me, though.
If that idea doesn't help you, try this instead: Say to yourself, "What doesn't kill me
makes me stronger. Chocolate doesn't kill me. Therefore chocolate makes me stronger." And
then go get some chocolate. It won't help the itch, but it might get your mind off it. Best I can
offer.

A BRIEF ASIDE ABOUT AN UNPOPULAR TOPIC

Once you get good at spotting poison ivy, it starts to become difficult not to spot poison
ivy. You'll start seeing it everywhere. With that knowledge comes a temptation...
I face that temptation just about every day at my house. You see, on the other side of the
street is a huge poison ivy vine growing in a wooded area. It is spreading seeds all throughout
the neighborhood, I'm sure. When I find a seedling on my property, it is hard not to imagine it
came from that one blasted vine. I would be overjoyed to be given the opportunity to kill it.
My problem is that it is not on my property. I know most of the neighbors, but I don't know the
owner of that particular piece of property. I don't have permission to be on that land; still less
do I have permission to kill anything on it. But then again, who'd know it was me? Our street
is not heavily trafficked, so the chances that anyone would spot me are minimal. I could make it
look like an accident. Surely I would be making the world a better place by just doing what I'm
tempted to do. More than likely, the owner wouldn't mind. The ends justify the means, right?
(Or so I'm tempted to tell myself).
And so we encounter a topic that few like to talk about: authority. (There are a few
people that go on and on about it; I try to avoid them whenever possible.) I kill poison ivy on
my land because I have the authority as property owner to do so. Poison ivy is not an
endangered species with legal protection. I am not using radioactive isotopes to kill poison ivy
(which would be illegal I'm sure). Any other legitimate authority over me is okay with my
poison ivy killing activities. When I go on someone else's property to kill poison ivy, it is
always with their permission and according to their directives. Anything else would entail
trespassing or worse. So I don't do it.
Once you decide you have the authority to just do whatever you think is for the greater
good for others, it is hard to stop. Once you decide you know what is best for others so that you
can override their decisions and their wishes, you're well on your way to becoming a terrible

person. You tell yourself that you can break the rules just this once, but domination and
defiance are powerfully addictive. Far better to learn to live by the rules and under legitimate
authority, even if it means having to kill poison ivy seedlings on your own property once a year.
I learned this lesson early from my dad. I noticed a poison ivy plant on a tree in a house
in our neighborhood, and asked if he was going to kill it. He replied that it wasn't his vine. He
pointed out that the person who owned that property might like it. That made no sense to me.
So he pointed out that some people might think that the shiny leaves are pretty. I remember
dropping the subject at that point, but I said to myself, "Some people are into the oddest things."
Many decades later I start to see the sense of that point of view. As I've been getting
older, I more and more can appreciate the sheer beauty of the sound of the phrase "Get off my
lawn." Somehow nothing says "get off my lawn" quite as dramatically as a lawn full of poison
ivy plants. (Okay, there's a plant that is found in the Mario video games that might say it better.
I want some of those on my lawn someday.) There's a reason that people grow rose bushes and
holly bushes around the windows of their house. I'm not sure that's always nice, but it is their
prerogative. My dad didn't explain it to me in those terms back then, but I'm sure he thought it.
So I'm thankful that I get to walk past someone else's poison ivy plant on a regular basis.
It gives me the opportunity over and over again to choose not to become a monster. I trust you
will make wise choices as well when faced with these sort of temptations.
(Okay, here's where I should admit that I don't always live up to my own convictions.
This past year I spotted a kudzu vine growing up a tree a few feet away from the neighbor's
poison ivy vine I just described. I ripped it down with a pole saw. My pole saw was long
enough so that I never trespassed on the neighbor's property. Still, I did it. Maybe I am
becoming a monster. Have to watch that.)

ONCE YOU HAVE YOUR OWN POISON IVY PROBLEM UNDER CONTROL
Once your battle against poison ivy has reached the "just killing the new seedling" stage,
you will have time on your hands and a lot of good experience. Consider putting it to good use.
I did.
For a few years, I have been taking on the task of controlling the poison ivy problem at a
couple of Christian camps in my area. These are camps that are doing good in our community;
they offer a message of hope to kids along with a lot of good outdoor fun. I care passionately
that kids be able to enjoy their time there without getting a rash that sucks all the fun out of their
experience. I am not in a position to help these camps out in other ways, so I just try to make
this one problem go away so they can focus on more important things.
I've also helped some other individuals and families with their poison ivy problem. It's
fun to be generous; it's good for you when you can help out others.
I note that I always offer my services for free. Not that I'm averse to making money and
not that I doubt that this is legitimate work. I just note that my not excepting money or
equivalent compensation means that I'm safe from a four-letter word that strikes fear in the hearts
of otherwise bold men and women nationwide. What word? (Brace yourself) OHSA! That's
right; by not performing this service for money I can prevent it from being an occupation. My
activities here are not under the jurisdiction of the Occupational Health and Safety
Administration. I have no idea of how they would regulate me if I was actually earning a
paycheck doing this, but I don't have to worry about that. Just turn around and walk away,

OHSA; you have no power here.
(Note that I'm a U.S. citizen, so I worry about OSHA. How Canada deals with this is
beyond my imagination. You might want to find out if you sing "Oh Canada" at sports events.)
There’s another reason I offer my services for free: If I were doing this for money, the
person paying me would have a legitimate authority to interfere with the way I do it. I know
how to do what I do, and I know how to minimize the risk to myself. I don’t want to have to
test out someone else’s ideas. I’m open to suggestions, but I really don’t want to have to put
myself at risk. By doing it as a favor, I can do it my way as long as I work within their
boundaries and give a good account of my activities to them. (In case you haven’t noticed, this
is also why I am offering you this document for free: I don’t want to have to be called into
account for the way I write. I’m writing for free, so I can say whatever I want. I think tapioca
pudding is abominable. You probably didn’t need to know that, but I’m saying it anyway so
there. You can’t complain you’re not getting your money’s worth.)
There are rewards more important than monetary rewards, and killing poison ivy can
offer that in a particularly special way. I quote the words of Jesus from Matthew 6:3-4 (NIV)
"But when you give to the needy, do not let your left hand know what your right hand is doing,
so that your giving may be in secret. Then your Father, who sees what is done in secret, will
reward you." So consider: by killing a reproducing vine you are preventing birds from eating
those berries and carrying those seeds who knows where. Poison ivy plants that otherwise
would be planted will not in fact be planted. Patches of poison ivy that otherwise might give
rashes won't be there to spread. The people who would otherwise have gotten poison ivy won't
realize what they have been spared from because of your gift to them. (They might not be
needy in the traditional sense, but I'm thinking that a person with a poison ivy rash has a very
definite need regardless of their economic or social status). Left hand has no idea what the right
hand just did, so secrecy is preserved. This gift I offer ultimately to my Heavenly Father, who
sees what might otherwise have been. It makes me happy knowing that He sees it.
Admittedly, my activity makes me happy for another reason too:
I don't like birds.
(Just kidding.)

AUTHOR'S AFTERWORD

I hope you enjoyed reading this document; I certainly enjoyed writing it. I offered it to
you without cost and without obligation, and I’m not altering the deal now. (If you paid
someone else for this document, that's between the two of you; I had nothing to do with that.)
Still, I think I’ve been nice enough to you that just maybe I’ve earned the right to have you listen
to a quick charitable donation sales-pitch: If you found this document to be informative or
entertaining, consider imagining what you might otherwise have paid for a document like this,
divide it in two, and pretty please think about donating that amount to an organization that gets
kids outdoors enjoying nature. If you don't know any of those, put it in a church offering plate
or donate it to some other worthy cause. That's entirely up to you. Your choice, but I’d really
appreciate it. There are a lot of wonderful, underfunded organizations out there, and I'd like to
do what I can for some of them.
What I'm really hoping, though, is that someone who reads this will decide to volunteer
helping out with controlling the poison ivy situation at a camp or other organization that gets

kids outdoors enjoying nature. Or some other worthy place; that's entirely up to you. The
people who run these places make the world a better place, and if you can take one worry away
from them and let them focus on other things, that’s huge. A weekend afternoon or two a year
can make a huge difference. I recommend it highly.

APPENDIX 1 - SPOT THE POISON IVY ANSWER KEY

APPENDIX 2 - QUESTIONS TO ASK
You're volunteering to help someone deal with a poison ivy problem. What should you say to
them? What should you ask?
- Where should I not go?
- Are you good friends with your neighbors?
- Any dangers I should be aware of?
- How's your cell phone signal? (Check)
- Have you noticed any wasp nests in your area? (Look for them) Poisonous snakes?
Venomous spiders? Revenuers?
Some things you should communicate:
- You are doing this not for pay or any cash equivalent services. You're using your own tools
and supplies. You would appreciate access to a bathroom and a source of drinking water.
- You assume the risk for your own activities. If you get bit by a copperhead, you would
appreciate help getting to an ambulance, but then after that you wouldn't mind getting laughed at.
You take a dim view of your host sneaking up behind you and whacking you upside the head
with a two by four, only it is okay as long as he yells "mosquito" as he does it.
- You're not offering any guarantee that poison ivy won't come back. In fact, if there's a
reproducing vine in the area, it will definitely grow back. You're here to get them started, but
ultimately it’s their land and their problem.
NEW CONTACT:
- Where's the bathroom?
- Can I get someone to show me the prpertyline and anythign else i need to know about keeping
self safe?
- How do you feel about Roundup?
- I'm going to leave the vines on the tree. Are you okay with that?
- Do you understand this is going to take years? If so, great; let’s get started....
