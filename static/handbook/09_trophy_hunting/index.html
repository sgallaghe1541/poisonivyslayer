  <h3>TROPHY HUNTING</h3>
</div>

<p class="col-start-1 col-span-2 row-start-1 row-span-1">Remember the camera? Remember the second reason for removing a section of the vine? Now it is time to have some fun. If you cut a section out of a particularly large or impressive vine, take a picture of it before disposing of it. Try to take a close up of the cut surface of the section. Use a flash, and try to be sure that it is not blurry.</p>
<p class="col-start-1 col-span-2 row-start-2 row-span-1">Later, try to count the tree rings so you can count the rings. It may be difficult to resolve all of them, but you should at least be able to get an approximate age of your vine. Here's one of mine. I kill poison ivy regularly at a local Bible camp; I thought I had killed all the reproducing vines on their property until I happened upon this beauty. I walked past this vine at least a half-dozen times before noticing it. It had mostly detached from the tree at the bottom, so it looked like an ordinary tree trunk. It wasn't until I looked up that I noticed that it was a reproducing poison ivy vine. Once I made one cut, the vine detached so I couldn't actually cut out a section; since the two ends no longer lined up, I figured I could tell at a glance that it was cut anyway.</p>

<p class="col-start-1 col-span-1 row-start-4 row-span-1">I took a picture of the underside of the cut. Here it is:</p>
<p class="col-start-1 col-span-1 row-start-5 row-span-1">Note that I've edited the picture by drawing lines on the rings. Every fifth line I draw in purple. My estimation is that this vine was 32 years old. So naturally, I told the people at camp, "I killed a 32 year old...poison ivy vine.". It's fun to say, particularly if you can string out the ellipsis long enough to get people worried. On a more serious note, there something very appealing about killing an old poison ivy vine. So much of like involves doing tasks to solve problems that will be back tomorrow or next week. Even monthly chores can become drudgery. As such, there's a marvelous sense of accomplishment that comes from solving a problem that has been growing for decades. Eventually, poison ivy slaying will become a once-a-year chore, so it is important and encouraging to remember what happens if you neglect it for long enough. Oh, and for what it's worth, here is my all-time record (so far):</p>

<p class="col-start-1 col-span-1 row-start-6 row-span-1">I'm thinking I can count 35 rings on it. This section was particularly heart-shaped. I can think of a number of awful pranks that I could pull by taking advantage of the heart-shaped nature of the poison ivy vine section, but I'm not going to do it. Really.</p>
