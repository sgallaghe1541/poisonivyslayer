  <h3>HOW TO HAVE A POISON IVY RASH</h3>
</div>

<p>Despite your best efforts, sometimes you get a rash from poison ivy. Proper precaution and experience will minimize the risk, but sometimes you get it nonetheless. I know. As I am typing this sentence, my right arm is itching like the proverbial dickens. There's a generalized itch, but there's only a few spots I can see. It might get worse tomorrow, but I'm pretty sure this will be it.</p>
<p>(Yes, it was poison ivy. It lasted a few days, and then it got better. I've had it a lot worse, but it is never fun when you get it.)</p>
<p>I note that there are many good medical websites out there describing poison ivy. They even have pictures. So I will direct you to one of them for more reliable information than I can provide you. Just avoid looking at the pictures; they'll give you the willies. When in doubt, talk to your doctor.</p>
<p>My experience has been that I have with me at all times a bottle of calamine lotion (or the equivalent) for one to three days after I've been out killing poison ivy. If I am actually going to get it, I will catch myself absentmindedly scratching at an itchy spot. Once I catch myself doing it, I immediately stop. (You don't want to scratch the itch; it will just make it worse.) I apply some lotion on the spot; not that it is really going to help but it will feel good having something to do instead of just itching. I note the spot and check it periodically. It might be nothing, but if it turns into an irregular patch of redness, I start chiding myself for not being more careful. If it starts to develop tiny blisters under the skin, I chide myself even worse. After that, I just try to keep it from getting further irritated, I put some lotion on it when it really bothers me, and I just wait for it to go away. You can't really "treat" a poison ivy rash - once the urushiol gets absorbed onto your skin, you just have to put up with it until it runs its course (usually a week to ten days). Scratching it won't spread the urushiol (I'm told), breaking the blisters won't spread the urushiol, but allowing it to heal undisturbed should diminish both the intensity and the duration of your suffering. Plus, you really don't want it to get infected. Be sure to seek medical attention if you have a fever, shortness of breath, or any of the other conditions that reliable medical advice websites list. Otherwise, you just have to put up with it.</p>
<p>As you suffer, you might as well consider whether or not there is an upside to having a poison ivy rash. I could consider the spiritual benefits of suffering, but I'm not really sure I'm qualified to do that. My life had been amazingly free of suffering. I'll leave that to the theologians and the pillar saints. I do have one interesting observation about what a poison ivy rash is like....</p>
<p>When you have a poison ivy rash, your skin has a legitimate complaint against you. You can say it was all for the greater good, but that's not going to help your skin. You can assign blame, but again that won't help. Your skin will be loudly complaining that conditions are unacceptable. You already know that, but it won't stop complaining. You try to do something to show you care, and maybe that reduces the intensity of it but doesn't solve it. Your skin wants you to scratch it, but you know that will not really help. Your skin won’t take no for an answer, but you’re the one in charge. If you give in, it might feel better for a moment but it will make your skin more miserable afterwards and perhaps do lasting damage. If you lose your composure, it only makes things worse. The nagging continues every waking hour, and might even invade your dreams. You just have to put up with that. You start desperately searching for a way of fixing the situation, but the sad truth is there isn't one and you and your skin are just going to have to accept that. And just when the situation seems beyond hope, things get better. Healing starts on its own without any help from you. Eventually, the problem just goes away, and both you and your skin will take it for granted (until the next time.)</p>
<p>Read that last paragraph again; what does it remind you of? To me, it reminds me of parenthood. Not all of parenthood, certainly. But some situations and some seasons just seem like that. So I consider having a poison ivy rash the to be good preparation and training for at least certain aspects of parenthood. Maybe that's just me, though.</p>
<p>If that idea doesn't help you, try this instead: Say to yourself, "What doesn't kill me makes me stronger. Chocolate doesn't kill me. Therefore chocolate makes me stronger." And then go get some chocolate. It won't help the itch, but it might get your mind off it. Best I can offer.</p>
