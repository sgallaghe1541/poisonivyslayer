### APPENDIX 2 - QUESTIONS TO ASK

You're volunteering to help someone deal with a poison ivy problem. What should you say to them? What should you ask?

- Where should I not go?
- Are you good friends with your neighbors?
- Any dangers I should be aware of?
- How's your cell phone signal? (Check)
- Have you noticed any wasp nests in your area? (Look for them) Poisonous snakes? Venomous spiders? Revenuers? Some things you should communicate:
- You are doing this not for pay or any cash equivalent services. You're using your own tools and supplies. You would appreciate access to a bathroom and a source of drinking water.
- You assume the risk for your own activities. If you get bit by a copperhead, you would appreciate help getting to an ambulance, but then after that you wouldn't mind getting laughed at. You take a dim view of your host sneaking up behind you and whacking you upside the head with a two by four, only it is okay as long as he yells "mosquito" as he does it.
- You're not offering any guarantee that poison ivy won't come back. In fact, if there's a reproducing vine in the area, it will definitely grow back. You're here to get them started, but ultimately it’s their land and their problem.

#### NEW CONTACT:

- Where's the bathroom?
- Can I get someone to show me the prpertyline and anythign else i need to know about keeping self safe?
- How do you feel about Roundup?
- I'm going to leave the vines on the tree. Are you okay with that?
- Do you understand this is going to take years? If so, great; let’s get started....
